## Combine multiple single fasta sequences into one combined file

This snippet of Python code enables you to input a folder directory containing many FASTA files containing a single sequence in each, and combine them all into one FASTA file. I initially found it cumbersome to manually copy and paste the FASTA sequence from each trimmed chromatogram file into one big FASTA file. This automates the process, and could be useful to folks who are generating FASTA files for alignments ðŸ˜ƒ.

```{python}

import os

DIR = input("\nInput folder path containing FASTA files to combine into one FASTA file: ")
os.chdir(DIR)
FILE_NAME = input("\nWhat would you like to name your output file (e.g. combo.fas)? Note: "
                  "Please add the .fas extension: ")
output_fas = open(FILE_NAME, 'w')
file_count = 0

for f in os.listdir(DIR):
    if f.endswith((".fas", ".fasta", ".FASTA")):
        file_count += 1
        fh = open(os.path.join(DIR, f))
        for line in fh:
            output_fas.write(line)
        fh.close()

output_fas.close()
print(str(file_count) + " FASTA files were merged into one file, which can be found here: " + DIR)

```
