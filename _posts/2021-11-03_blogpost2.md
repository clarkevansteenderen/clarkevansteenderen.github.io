Perhaps a published paper lists their GenBank accession numbers as a range; for example KC664779 - KC665461. 
In R, one can use the following code to download all the sequences in this range, and save them as a FASTA file:

``` r
start = 664779
end = 665461

# create an empty vector to store the sequences
desired_sequences = c()

# run a loop to generate all the sequence IDs
k = 0
for (i in start:end){
  desired_sequences[k] = paste("KC", i, sep = "")
  k = k + 1
}

# access the GenBank sequences in the list using the ape read.GenBank function
output = ape::read.GenBank(desired_sequences)
# store the GenBank sequences as a FASTA file
ape::write.dna(output, file ="my_seqs.fasta", format = "fasta", append = FALSE, nbcol = 6, colsep = "", colw = 10)
```
