title: "BinMat: A molecular genetics tool for processing binary data obtained from fragment analysis in R"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/binmat
excerpt: 'Processing and visualising trends in the binary data (presence or absence of
electropherogram peaks), obtained from fragment analysis methods in molecular biology,
can be a time-consuming and often cumbersome process. Scoring and analysing binary
data (from methods, such as AFLPs, ISSRs and RFLPs) entail complex workflows that
require a high level of computational and bioinformatic skills. The application presented
here (BinMat) is a free, open-source and user-friendly R Shiny programme (https://
clarkevansteenderen.shinyapps.io/BINMAT/) that automates the analysis pipeline on one
platform. It is also available as an R package on the Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN) (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BinMat/index.html). BinMat consolidates
replicate sample pairs of binary data into consensus reads, produces summary statistics
and allows the user to visualise their data as ordination plots and clustering trees without
having to use multiple programmes and input files or rely on previous programming
experience. [PDF](https://github.com/clarkevansteenderen/clarkevansteenderen.github.io/blob/master/files/BinMat_BDJ_article_77875.pdf)'
