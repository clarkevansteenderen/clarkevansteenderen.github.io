title: "Sample size assessments for thermal physiology studies: An R package and R Shiny GUI."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/thermalsampler_2023
excerpt: 'Required sample sizes for a study need to be carefully assessed to account for logistics, cost, ethics and statistical rigour. For example, many studies have shown that methodological variations can impact the critical thermal limits (CTLs) recorded for a species, although studies on the impact of sample size on these measures are lacking. Here, we present ThermalSampleR; an R CRAN package and Shiny application that can assist researchers in determining when adequate sample sizes have been reached for their data. The method is particularly useful because it is not taxon specific. The Shiny application offers a user-friendly interface equivalent to the package for users not familiar with R programming. ThermalSampleR is accompanied by an in-built example dataset, which we use to guide the user through the workflow with a fully worked tutorial.'
