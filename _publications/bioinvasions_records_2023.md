excerpt: 'An undescribed phytophagous wasp belonging to the Tetramesa genus (Hymenoptera:
Eurytomidae), that is native to South Africa, is currently being investigated as a
potential weed biological control agent for the invasive grass Eragrostis curvula
(Poaceae) in Australia. Host-specificity testing is underway in South Africa, but the
wasp has not been exported into quarantine in Australia and further research is required
before it could be considered for release. Here, we used DNA barcoding to demonstrate
that Tetramesa specimens collected on invasive E. curvula populations in Australia
represent the same wasp species currently being investigated in South Africa. We
discuss our findings in the context of developing a biological control programme
against E. curvula in Australia and the potential risk posed to native Australian
grasses'
