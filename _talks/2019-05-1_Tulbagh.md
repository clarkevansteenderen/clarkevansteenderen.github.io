The ability to use genetic barcoding tools to distinguish between the species and intraspecific ‘biotypes’ within the Dactylopius genus (Hemiptera: Dactylopiidae) is highly beneficial to the biological control of cactaceous weeds in South Africa. The present study used DNA sequencing and ISSR fragment analysis methods to create a database of genetic barcodes for Dactylopius species found in the country, as well as from the native range, with a particular focus on the biotypes found within Dactylopius opuntiae. This has important applications in the mass rearing of pure insect cultures and the inoculation of the most effective biotype on target Cactaceae.
