# About Me

I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Zoology and Entomology at Rhodes University in South Africa, and am part of the [Centre for Biological Control](https://www.ru.ac.za/centreforbiologicalcontrol/) research group. 

I enjoy working on projects that involve answering phylogenetic and evolutionary questions, and I particularly love writing my own code and creating user-friendly applications. 

ðŸ“Œ Please check out the [tutorials](https://github.com/clarkevansteenderen/CBC_Tutorials) I have created that cover how to run a variety of phylogenetic analyses, from sequence alignments to tree-building.

My blog covers all kinds of odds and ends that I find interesting; mostly snippets of code that can help with phylogenetic data preparation.

Please get in touch with me if you would like to collaborate on a project!
