# About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Zoology and Entomology at Rhodes University in South Africa, and am part of the [Centre for Biological Control](https://www.ru.ac.za/centreforbiologicalcontrol/) research group. 

I enjoy working on projects that involve answering phylogenetic and evolutionary questions, and I particularly love writing my own code and creating user-friendly applications. 

ðŸ“Œ Please check out the [tutorials](https://github.com/clarkevansteenderen/CBC_Tutorials) I have created that cover how to run a variety of phylogenetic analyses, from sequence alignments to tree-building.

My blog covers all kinds of odds and ends that I find interesting; mostly snippets of code that can help with phylogenetic data preparation.

Please get in touch with me if you would like to collaborate on a project!

# Current work

* RADseq population genetic work, focusing on the native South African crystalline ice plant (*Cryophytum crystallinym*) that is invasive in the USA.
  
* A genetic investigation of the native stem-boring *Tetramesa* wasps in South Africa: identifying potential biological control agents of invasive grasses.

* Species distribution modelling for the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) - a risk assessment for South Africa. A collaboration with Evans Mauda and Wayne Kirkman at Citrus Research International (CRI)
