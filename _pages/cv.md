## Project experience

* **PhD** A genetic investigation of the native stem-boring \textit{Tetramesa} wasps in South Africa: identifying potential biological control agents of invasive grasses
* **MSc** Using genetic barcoding methods to identify the different species and intra-specific lineages of *Dactylopius* Costa used as biological control agents of invasive Cactaceae
* **Honours** The biological control of water hyacinth under eutrophic conditions and the effects of different herbivorous feeding guilds on plant health and defenses
* **Honours** The determination of the efficacy of a unisexual vs a bisexual sterile insect release for the false codling moth (*Thaumatotibia leucotreta* Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae); a major citrus pest in South Africa. I also compared mating preference and successful mating ability between sterile and wild adults
* **Third year** The efficacy of a host-specific granulovirus (PlxyGV) under field conditions on the biological control of the diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella* L.)
* **Third year** The extent of microplastic pollution along the South African coastline using indigenous (*Perna perna*) and invasive (*Mytilus galloprovincialis*) mussel tissue as indicators
