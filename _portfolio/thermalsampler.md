`ThermalSampleR` is an R package and R Shiny GUI application designed by myself and Guy Sutton
to assess sample size requirements for researchers performing
critical thermal limits (CTL) studies (e.g.Â calculating CTmin or CTmax
metrics). Much research has been performed in recent years to improve
the methodology used during CTL studies, however, we are not aware of
any research into the sample size requirements for these studies. Our
package and GUI application allows users to perform sample size assessments for both
single-species studies and multi-species comparisons.

`ThermalSampleR` is a companion package to the pending publication
(currently under review):

Owen, C.A., Sutton, G.F., Martin, G.D., van Steenderen, C.J.M., and
Coetzee, J.A. 2021. Sample size planning for critical thermal limits studies.
