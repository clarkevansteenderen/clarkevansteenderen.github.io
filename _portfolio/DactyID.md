This program is designed for the quick identification of unknown *Dactylopius* (Hemiptera: Dactylopiidae) DNA sequences, but can be applied to any taxon if the relevant database of genetic sequences is supplied. The user can either upload a database of their choice, or can select from those provided (12S, 18S, and two COI markers). 
The sequences in this database are associated with the publication [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964420306538).
