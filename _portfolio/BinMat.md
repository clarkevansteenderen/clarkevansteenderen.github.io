BinMat is an R Shiny application and R package that was written to rapidly consolidate binary matrices derived from dominant marker genetic analyses (such as for inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs)). This can be applied to data consisting of replicate pairs, or it can be used to consolidate the entire dataset (i.e. treating all the samples uploaded as replicates for one sample). The user is also able to generate interactive non-metric MDS plots, and filter their data according to a specified minimum peak number threshold.

See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/clarkevansteenderen/BinMat) for further details and user instructions.
